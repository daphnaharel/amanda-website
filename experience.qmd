I received my undergraduate degree from Hamilton College in sociology with a minor in education. I then obtained my Masters degree from Simmons College in Special Education in 2011.

I have worked in school-based settings for the last 15 years. Through working as a one-on-one aide, a classroom teacher, and a learning specialist, I have learned that each child requires unique and personalized assistance. I am excited to bring the skills that I have gained through my previous work experiences to working with your child.
