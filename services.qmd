I work with individual children and small groups for tutoring and executive functioning coaching in Lower Manhattan and many areas of Downtown Brooklyn. I believe that the best way for children to learn is through in-person interactions and, therefore, I am not taking on virtual clients at this time.

To learn more about how I can help you and your children, as well as my rates, packages, and options, please contact me by email [amanda dot iturbe at gmail dot com]{.underline}. I am happy to setup a 15 minute phone or zoom consultation call to discuss what options are best for you and your child.
