    "text": "I received my undergraduate degree from Hamilton College in sociology with a minor in education. I then obtained my Masters degree from Simmons College in Special Education in 2011.\nI have worked in school-based settings for the last 15 years. Through working as a one-on-one aide, a classroom teacher, and a learning specialist, I have learned that each child requires unique and personalized assistance. I am excited to bring the skills that I have gained through my previous work experiences to working with your child."

    "text": "I work with individual children and small groups for tutoring and executive functioning coaching in Lower Manhattan and many areas of Downtown Brooklyn. I am also familiar with the process of obtaining evaluations for children, and working with parents to guide them through the process of developing an IEP and accommodation plan for their child.\nI believe that the best way for children to learn is through in-person interactions and, therefore, I am not taking on virtual clients at this time.\nTo learn more about how I can help you and your children, as well as my rates, packages, and options, please contact me by email amanda dot iturbe at gmail dot com. I am happy to setup a 15 minute phone or zoom consultation call to discuss what options are best for you and your child."

I specialize in helping upper-elementary, middle, and high school children with subject area content - including math and science - and organization skills, time management, and executive functioning.\nWhether your child has an official diagnosis, IEP, support plan, or not, I am able to both tutor your child and set up a homework routine for when I am not present. I can also provide you with guidance as to what official accommodations may be appropriate for your child at school. I have helped numerous children obtain evaluations, and worked to get the results of those evaluations translated into actionable strategies that result in the child’s success."
