I believe that the best way for children to learn is through in-person interactions and, therefore, am not taking on virtual clients at this time.\nTo learn more about how I can help you and your children, as well as my rates, packages, and options, please contact me by email amanda dot iturbe at gmail dot com. I am happy to setup a 15 minute consultation phone or zoom call to discuss options."
